### SKYLINE WORKFLOW
**Rationale**
Different softwares can vary in peak picking and peak integration as they use different bioinformatics workflow. Therefore we combined the peaks recognized by different softwares into single file. The overlapping peaks from different software are combined into single peak if they share the common precursor mass (5ppm tolerance) and retention time with a tolerance of 0.1 min.
